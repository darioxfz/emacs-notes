* Basics
Many things in racket are polyvariadic meaning that they can take any number of arguments
>(+ 1 1 1 1 2 2 3)
** Expressions

>(+ 2 2)

>(- 2 2)

>(/ 4)

>(max 2 3 3 4)

exponents
>(expt 2 3)


substrings
>(substring "this is nice" 3 6)

>(length '(0 1 2 3))

** Definitions and interactions

-define a function

>(define id expr)

**  Lists, Iteraction and Recursion

-first element of a list

>(car 1 2 3 4) or (first 1 2 3 4)

-rest of the list

>(cdr 1 2 3 4) or (rest 1 2 3 4)

** others

time
i can time how long my functions take to compute using the time function form base library

(time (function x) #t)

#t in the end means only the time that function took computing will be shown
